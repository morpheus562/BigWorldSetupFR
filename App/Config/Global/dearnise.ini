[Description]
Mod-EN=The mod adds a romantic relationship between Nalia and a male player character who is human, elven, half-elven, or dwarven, of any character class and alignment. We don't know what happens if also "Arnel's Nalia Romance" is installed, but common sense suggests that at the very least, installing two dedicated PC/Nalia romances would be a poor idea.
