[Description]
Mod-EN=PaintBG is a mod that replaces each of the NPC portraits of Baldur's Gate with original artwork by artastrophe. This portrait pack also overwrites the PC portraits included in the original game with new images to choose from! As always, each of these components is available to install separately.
