[Description]
Mod-EN=This WeiDU mod allows you to biff the content of the override folder for improved performance, that means the files are converted into the BIF file format and moved into the data folder. The game thereby loads much faster again and the performance is running pretty smoothly without jerking. It is compatible with the common WeiDU stack uninstall operation.
