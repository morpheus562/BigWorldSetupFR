[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod inserts missing portraits to all non-player characters (NPC) which have to do something directly with quests, avoids the double portraits for different characters, however, leaves existing portraits of NPC-Mods unchanged. Pictures of celebrities and sign styles which do not fit to the world of Baldur were avoided. Particular attention was given to to the character portrayals on the fact that they also fit to the respective characters. Bad characters mostly have also bad expressions, while good characters are to be recognized unambiguously. No images received normal passers-by or other avatars who are only for decoration, have nothing to do with quests, or have otherwise nothing important to say.
