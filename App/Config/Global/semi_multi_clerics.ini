[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod will add various clerical spells to wizard magic users via a new item, effectively turning them into previously unavailable X/Cleric kits/multiclass combinations. The semi-multi learns and uses spells as per a normal Arcane caster, and also has access to 35 clerical spells. It is not recommend to use "Semi Multi Clerics" with "Spell Revisions" as conceptually they are on opposite extremes. "Spell Revisions" is trying to "rebalance" spells, while that mod purposely makes them unbalancing again.
