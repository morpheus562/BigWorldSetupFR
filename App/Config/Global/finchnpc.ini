[Description]
Mod-EN=Finch Bloomwhiffler, a neutral good gnome cleric of Deneir, is quick to enthuse about stories she has read, libraries she has visited and tomes that she has had the honor to copy, but for all her knowledge, Finch has never truly experienced a life of adventure outside the pages of a book until you encounter her. Banter with Indira and Mur'Neth custom NPCs, if installed.
